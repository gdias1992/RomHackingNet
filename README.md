# RomHacking.net Archive Explorer

A high-performance, local-first web interface designed to browse, search, and manage the 2024 RomHacking.net data backup.

## 🚀 The Goal
To replace the original web interface with a snappy, modern experience optimized for `localhost` usage. This project allows you to navigate the massive collection of ROM hacks, translations, and utilities entirely offline.
