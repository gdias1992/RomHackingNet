This is the content I obtained from romhacking.net.

My Bitdefender antivirus flagged some files as containing viruses, which may be false positives.

Use this at your own discretion, or feel free to obtain the files yourself. A torrent for this content is also available on the internet.

The following folders should be placed inside the `cdn` directory:
