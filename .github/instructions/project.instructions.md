# Project Guidelines

- Every major change should be reflected in the [README.md](README.md) if it affects the high-level project description or setup instructions.
- The project structure must be maintained and documented in [STRUCTURE.md](STRUCTURE.md). Any new directories or significant architecture changes must be updated there immediately.
- Use the established directory structure for backend (FastAPI) and frontend (React + Vite) as defined in [STRUCTURE.md](STRUCTURE.md).
